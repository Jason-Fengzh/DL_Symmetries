# Dictionary Learning with Symmetries Compared with Vanilla DL.
This is the code base for numerical experiments for the paper "Dictionary Learning with Symmetries via Representation Theory
 "
 
 
 Authors: Yong Sheng Soh, Zhuohang Feng, Subhroshekhar Ghosh, Aaron Yi Rui Low.
 
 
 ## Instructions
 1. To replicate the experiment on DL with symmetries (our method), run Sym_DL.m.
 2. To replicate the experiment on Vanilla DL, run Baseline.m.
 3. To view the graph result of comparison with the two methods (which actually contains 1 and 2), run Graphs.m.
 4. Other files are functions contributing to the above three codes. The code for constructing linear map from tensor space to Wigner D-matrix space is at LinearL.m.The code for generating random data is at Data.m. The code for calculating distance between two data points up to some proper rotation is at infidist.m.
